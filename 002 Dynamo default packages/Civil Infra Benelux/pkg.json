The amount of Points should be the same as the amount of Adaptive points of the Elements, CurveAlignByPoint - Aligns all Curve to the same point, CurveDivideByDistance - Returns all properties along a Curve by a specified distance. Points, Parameters, Planes, SegmentLengths, Tangents and Normals, CurveDivideByDistanceSurface - Returns all properties, including surfaces, along a Curve by a specified distance. Points, Surfaces, Parameters, Planes, SegmentLengths, Tangents and Normals, CurveDivideWithOffset - Divides a Curve using a Chord length offset and a Chord length distance, CurveSortAlongCurve - Sorts a list of curves in order along an other curve, ElementFamilyInstance - Returns the FamilyInstance corresponding with a Element, ElementGetAnalyticalModel - Returns the Analytical Model element of a given Element is this Element has one, ElementIsolateInView - This node will take input of elements and a view to isolate selected elements in a view., ElementRotate - Rotates an element, ElementSetWorkset - Set the workset of an element, ExcelColumnByHeader - Returns the column  corresponding with the selected Header, FamilyInstanceByNumberAlongCurves - Places a number of Family Instances parallel to a Curve., FamilyInstanceBySpacingAlongCurves - Places a number of Family Instances parallel to a Curve., FamilyTypeByAssemblyCode - Returns all Family types with the given Assembly code as a string, FamilyTypeDoesExist - Checks if the given Family name exists in the current Document, FloorTypeByMaterialAndThickness - Creates a Floor Type  or Slab Type by Material and Thickness. Structural = True for a Slab Type, False for a Floor Type, FormSetSubcategory - Sets the Subcategory of the created Form, FormulaCrossEquation - Calculates value A2 for A1 x B1 == A2 x B2, FormulaPythagoras - Returns the lengths of the sides A B & C, GeometryTransformProjectToShared - Transforms objects from Shared Coordinates to Project Coordinates, since Dynamo calculates with Project Coordinates, GeometryTransformSharedToProject - Transforms objects from Shared Coordinates to Project Coordinates, since Dynamo calculates with Project Coordinates, LevelZero - Return the Level with an Projected Elevation of 0. Often refered to as \"Sealevel\", ListMakeSubLists - Divides a List in Sub Lists. Each Sub List Starts with the Last Item of the Previous Sub List. Perfect for create point lists for Adaptive Components, ListNumberToString - Turns a List of Integers into Strings, MathEvensOdds - Filters the Odd and Even numbers from a List, MeshToPolySurface - Converts a Mesh to a PolySurface, PolyCurveOffsetNonPlanar - Offsets a non-planar Polycurve in Vertical and Horizontal Distance, RevitDocumentCoordination - Returns all Coordination info from the current Revit model, ScopeBoxByBoundingBox - Creates a Section Box in a Specific View by a given Bounding Box, SolidRoadMarking - Sweeps a rectangular profile along a curve with or without spacing., SortPointsByDistance - Sorts a List of Points by Distance Between them starting with the first point in the List, SubCategoryByName - Checks if the given Family name exists in the current Document, SubcategoryGetProperties - Get the properties of the Subcategory, SubCategoryName - Returns the name of the given Subcategory, SubCategorySetProperties - Set the Different Properties of the Subcategory like: Line Weights, Line Pattern, Line Colors and Material, TopographyToPolySurface - Converts a Toposurface into a PolySurface, UITools.SearchElements - Opens a UI in which all the Element names are displayed. The user can type in a Search Term to search all the items., UITools.SearchItems - Creates a Selection UI where the user can search and select multiple items from a List., ViewDuplicate - Duplicates a given View, ViewDuplicateAsDependend - Duplicates a given View as a Depended View, ViewDuplicateWithDetailing - Duplicates a given View with all detailing elements, ViewSortFiltersAlphabetically - Sorts the Filters of a given View in Alpabetical order, WallTypeByMaterialAndThickness - Creates a Wall Type by Material and Thickness, WorksetByName - Creates or Gets a workset by a given name","engine_version":"1.3.4.6666","engine":"dynamo","engine_metadata":"","site_url":"","repository_url":"","contains_binaries":true,"node_libraries":["Package.customization, Version=0.0.0.0, Culture=neutral, PublicKeyToken=null"]}
